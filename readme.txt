This is a time visualiser / leisure activity visualiser. With this website you can enter in your day-to-day activities, save them on your pc as a JSON file and then load that JSON file back up onto the website to see your activities on a pie chart that has three coresponding colours depending on how long you have spent on that activity.

You can either create your own leisure activities or select the time_data.json that already has activities inside it to test out the pie chart.

You should run the .bat file and have python installed on your pc with python being set up on the computer's PATH. If this is not done there may be some CORS errors.
